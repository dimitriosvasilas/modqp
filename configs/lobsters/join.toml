# - the first attribute in 'Projection' is the one to use for the join and is treated as libqpu.INT
#   (better make sure it actually is libqpu.INT)
# - the order of JoinConfig.Source entries match the order of connecions
# - i.e. the 1st entry of source is used to construct queries that are then sent to
#   the 1st connection, etc.
